# ArcGIS Story Maps
An introductory tutorial for ArcGIS Story Maps

[ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html) is a [Geographic Information System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) platform.

It has high end professional applications and functionality, but also provides a free and public online version through which geographic data can be mapped and augmented with a variety of supplementary applications.

[Here are some examples of what you can do with ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/home/gallery.html#c=esri&t=maps&o=modified)

The supplementary application we're interested in today is called [Story Maps](http://www.arcgis.com/home/gallery.html#c=esri&t=maps&o=modified&f=storymaps).

Story Maps is a powerful tool that allows you to integrate an audiovisual narrative with the relevant geographic relationships between the moments of the narrative and their spatial locations.
