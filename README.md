# ArcGIS Story Maps
An introductory tutorial for ArcGIS Story Maps

[ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html) is a [Geographic Information System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) platform.

It has high end professional applications and functionality, but also provides a free and public online version through which geographic data can be mapped and augmented with a variety of supplementary applications.

[Here are some examples of what you can do with ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/home/gallery.html#c=esri&t=maps&o=modified)

The supplementary application we're interested in today is called [Story Maps](http://www.arcgis.com/home/gallery.html#c=esri&t=maps&o=modified&f=storymaps).

Story Maps is a powerful tool that allows you to integrate an audiovisual narrative with the relevant geographic relationships between the moments of the narrative and their spatial locations.

## Getting Started

ArcGIS uses the "freemium" model, so though they provide various professional versions of their platform with high functionality for a cost, they also provide free public accounts. Before we get started, go to the [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/features/index.html) portal and create a free public account.

When you've done that, click on the "Map" tab of the main menu. From the Arc GIS Online frontpage, you can also access a Gallery to see the potential of ArcGIS Online, or access the maps you've made under "My Content", once you've created some.

In the "Map" section, you should be taken to this screen:
